`has` is a modern replacement for the traditional `test` tool. It allows
querying properties of Git repositories and indicates success through the exit
code.

### query files and folders

```
has [no] file <file name>
has [no] folder <folder name>
```

### query Git branches

```
has [no] branch <branch name>
```
